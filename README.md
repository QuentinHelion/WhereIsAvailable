## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm
- A [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/) account and a valid API key for [streaming-availability.p.rapidapi.com](https://rapidapi.com/movie-of-the-night-movie-of-the-night-default/api/streaming-availability)

### Installation
```sh
npm install
```

### Configuration
1. **API Key**
   - Create a `.env` file at the project root:
     ```env
     VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here
     ```
   - Restart the dev server after any change to `.env`.

2. **Countries and Platforms**
   - `countries.json` (at project root): List of country codes and names (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)
   - `src/platforms.json`: List of supported platforms (id, name, icon)

### Run the app (development)
```sh
npm run dev
```
Then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage
- Select one or more platforms (checkboxes)
- Choose Movie or Series (radio)
- Enter the title
- Click **Search**
- Watch the tested countries in real time in the mini-console
- Cancel at any time with the **Cancel** button
- If found, the result shows the country, platform, and raw API data

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Limitations
- **CORS**: The app makes direct calls to RapidAPI. If you get CORS errors, you may need to use a backend proxy.
- **API Quota**: Free RapidAPI plans have a limited number of requests per day.
- **Speed**: The app stops at the first country where the title is found, but may take time if the title is rare.
- **Subscription only**: Only results with `type: 'subscription'` are shown (no rental/buy).
- **Data freshness**: Results depend on the accuracy and update frequency of the RapidAPI provider.
